# Asteroids Avoidance Game

This project was created as a part of a college assignment to work with more sophisticated code and to explore the possibilities within the C programming language. The objective of the game is to maneuver a ship through a field populated with asteroids, avoiding collisions to stay alive.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**:

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your machine. For instance, you can use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC):

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

**Clone the Repository**:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
3. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL of the repository.
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alexjohnyoung/AsteroidGame.git

**Compilation**:

    gcc -o game src/*.c -lm

This will create an executable file named **game**. Run as required.
